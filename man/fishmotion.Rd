\description{
A pair of event tables (in a list) documenting the movements of tagged Coho Salmon (\emph{Oncorhynchus kisutch}) in Bear Creek (Southwest Alaska, USA) for 29 July - 19 August 2008. Table \code{motion} lists individual fish residence time intervals in each of three stream regions, while table \code{origin} lists the study-wide residence time of each fish and the stream region in which the fish was first tagged.

\itemize{
  \item from, to - start and end times as seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC (POSIXct)
  \item fish.id - unique identifer for each fish
  \item region - stream region (1 = 0 - 930 m, a cold downstream region with abundant and spawning sockeye salmon; 2 = 930 - 1360 m, a cold middle region with few if any sockeye salmon; 3 = > 1360 m, a warm upstream region where sockeye salmon were absent)
