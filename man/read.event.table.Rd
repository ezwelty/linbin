\title{Read File as Event Table}
\usage{
read.event.table(file, from.col = "from", to.col = "to", sep = "",
  header = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{name, \code{\link{connection}}, or \code{\link{url}} of the file to be read as an event table.}

\item{from.col,to.col}{names or indices of the columns containing event endpoints. Values are swapped as needed to ensure that \code{to â‰¥ from} on all rows.}

\item{sep}{character seperating values on each line of the file. If \code{sep = ""} (the default), the separator is 'white space' (that is, any combination of one or more spaces, tabs, newlines and carriage returns).}

\item{header}{logical value indicating whether the file contains column names as its first line. If \code{FALSE}, columns will be named "V" followed by the column number, unless \code{col.names} (a vector of optional column names) is provided as an additional argument.}

\item{...}{additional arguments, of the form \code{tag = value}, to be passed directly to \code{\link{read.table}} to control how the file is read.}
}
\value{
An event table, the \code{data.frame} object used by \code{linbin} to describe interval data.
}
\description{
Reads a file in table format and attempts to coerce it to an event table.
}
\details{
The file is read into R by calling \code{\link{read.table}}. Any of its arguments can be set by passing additional \code{tag = value} pairs to \code{read.event.table}. \code{from.col} and \code{to.col} are renamed to "from" and "to" as needed. Since these column names must be unique, other columns cannot also be called "from" or "to".
