Title: Binning and Plotting of Linearly Referenced Data
Description: Short for "linear binning", the linbin package provides functions for manipulating,
  binning, and plotting linearly referenced data. Although developed for data collected on river
  networks, it can be used with any interval or point data referenced to a 1-dimensional coordinate 
  system. Flexible bin generation and batch processing makes it easy to compute and visualize 
  variables at multiple scales, useful for identifying patterns within and between variables and
  investigating the influence of scale of observation on data interpretation.
